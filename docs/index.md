# `rain`

ReseArch Infrastructure Network (`rain`) is a Python package that allows users to exchange messages between each other. This package was created with the purpose of sending status information between research infrastructure in the Arctic regions of the Nordics. However `rain`'s scope is not limited to this specific use case.
The communication network is set up in a decentralised peer-to-peer configuration, allowing users to run servers and clients. The communication takes place in the form of JSON messages over a TCP/IP connection.
